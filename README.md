# TJBot: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This is a project to build/program a simple, caring emotionally intelligent robot using IBMâ€™s TJBot and Watson Services. New functionalities will be added to the TJBot to best fit the project goals. The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.

### OVERVIEW OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE REQUIRED

      * Text to Speech (enables TJBot to speak)
      * Tone Analyzer (enables TJBot to detect emotions in text)
      * Watson Assistant (builds conversational interface with TJBot)
      * Visual Recognition (trains TJBot to recognize facial expressions) 
      * Node.js (to interface with these Watson Services)
      * Twitter API (to allow TJBot to detect emotions in tweets)
      * TJBot library to abstract basic functions for TJBot shown [here](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbotlib). 
      * Node.js library to access IBM Watson Services shown [here]https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk
        * Installation instructions shown [here]https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk

### TJBot and Watson System Overview

![](references/tjbotWatson.png)

In summary, for this project the TJBot Client application makes requests from Watson Services for the Speech to Text Service to send user speech to text conversions, a request to the Assistant service to update service context to represent the detected tone, and generate requests for additional responses from TJBot, and request to the Text-To-Speech service to convert TJBot's text to voice to speak back to the user. 

### WATSON CLOUD SERVICES OVERVIEW

An excellent reference on how the client services interface with the Watson servier is shown in IBM's [Watson Cloud Service Deep Dive Manual](https://github.com/vnoelifant/tjbot-caring/blob/master/references/wcs_deepdive.pdf). 



 **IN WORK**: System flow diagram updates and data flow description updates. 
In addition, the following Watson CLoud Service documentation should be read over to understand how to use the Watson Services. 

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/assistant/getting-started.html#getting-started

The following section will especially be used for incorporating dialogue. 

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/assistant/dialog-overview.html#dialog-overview

Key Watson Assistant Dialogue tools for enhancing dialogue:

Intents:
 Intents are purposes or goals expressed in a customer's input, such as answering a question or processing a bill payment. By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.
