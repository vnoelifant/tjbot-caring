# TJBot: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This is a project to build/program a simple, caring emotionally intelligent robot using IBMâ€™s TJBot and Watson Services. New functionalities will be added to the TJBot to best fit the project goals. The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.

## **Weekly Goals**:

* Week 1/21/19
  * Get the robot fully functional (get the arm waving)
  * Figure out what is needed for IBM Cloud/Watson Services
    * What services do I need?
    * What do the services do?
    * Why do I think I need the services?
    * How much will services cost?
    * What are the restrictions
    * Create the Watson services

* Week 1/28/19
  * Work on Step 2 from the proposal (focus on tone detection)
    * User initiates negative tone 
    * Program robot to respond 
    * Plan out how to go beyond existing demos (ideas are in the proposal)
    * Execute tests

* Week 2/4/19
  * Continue Step 2
  * Test, debug, refine

* Week 2/11/19
  * Finish up Step 2
  * Begin Step 3 from proposal 
    * User initiates positive tone
    * Program robot to respond

* Week 2/18/19
  * Contine Step 3
  * Test, debug, refine

* Week 2/25/19
  * Begin Step 4 from proposal
  * Robot detects quiet environment
  * Program robot to initiate dialogue
  * This is one of the big sretch goals, so if there are issues, or it is too timily to implement, go back and optimize existing functionalities (for instance, explore the facial recognition and Twitter API capabilities)

* Week 3/4/19
  * Continue Step 4
  * Test, debug, refine
  * If not implementing Step 4, continue optimizing other functionalities

* Week 3/11/19
  * Execute working tests
  * Begin final report and video
  * Work on finalizing Github repo

* Week 3/18/19
  * Clean up any of the remaining final tasks (report/video/repo)
  * Prepare for demo
